# rugc-problem-maps
Problematic maps that are up for download on the server in case you don't want to use google drive for whatever reason/don't have access to it. To be used with: https://gist.github.com/iv-ry/3989c54181bc9a505dc7ed54998c78cb
## INSTALLATION GUIDE ##
1. Download your problematic map of choice and drop it into your designated folder.
2. Drop the downloaded files into your TF map folder, guide path:
Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\download\maps
3. (OPTIONAL) If you're having trouble finding your local Team Fortress 2 files, try:
- Right clicking on Team Fortress 2 in your library list
- Clicking on properties
- Clicking on local files and then clicking on Browse
- Then finding the correct folder that way.
## HOW TO GET THE .BSP FILE FROM BZ2 FILE TYPES ##
1. Unzip the downloaded file by right clicking the .bz2 file and hovering over whatever your .zip program is (For my case, it's 7zip) and then clicking on "Extract files"
2. Extract the files to your desiginated folder of choice and then follow the instructions in the installation guide above. In order for it to work, make sure you're transferring the .bsp file that you have unzipped otherwise it will **not** work.
